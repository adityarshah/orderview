# Magento 2 Order Quick View module
This is a simple module for Magento 2 administrator to view orders in a nice popup from admin panel sales order grid. The module is basically inspired by woocommerce order quick view functionality in WordPress framework.

The module will add a new column to Magento sales order grid like below.
